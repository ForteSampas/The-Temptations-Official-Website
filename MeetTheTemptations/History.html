    <h5>The Temptations are an American vocal group from Detroit, Michigan, who released a series of successful 
        singles and albums with Motown Records during the 1960s to mid 1970s. The group's work with producer 
        Norman Whitfield, beginning with the Top 10 hit single "Cloud Nine" in October 1968, pioneered 
        psychedelic soul, and was significant in the evolution of R&B and soul music. The band members are 
        known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and dress style. Having sold tens of millions of albums, 
        The Temptations are among the most successful groups in popular music.</h5>

    <h5>Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with fewer or more members), the group 
        formed in 1960 in Detroit under the name the Elgins. The founding members came from two rival Detroit 
        vocal groups: Otis Williams, Elbridge "Al" Bryant, and Melvin Franklin of Otis Williams & the Distants, and 
        Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams of the Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin, who was 
        the lead vocalist on a number of the group's biggest hits, including "My Girl" (1964), "Ain't Too Proud to 
        Beg" (1966), and "I Wish It Would Rain" (1967). Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by Dennis Edwards, with 
        whom the group continued to record hit records such as "Cloud Nine" (1968), "I Can't Get Next to You" 
        (1969), and "Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)" (1970). Kendricks and Paul Williams both 
        left the group in 1971, with subsequent members including Richard Street, Damon Harris, Glenn Leonard, 
        Ron Tyson, and Ali-Ollie Woodson, the last of whom was the lead singer on late-period hit "Treat Her Like a 
        Lady" in 1984 and the theme song for the children's movement program Kids in Motion in 1987.</h5>

        <h5>Over the course of their career, the Temptations released four Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and 
          fourteen R&B number-one singles. Their music has earned four Grammy Awards. The Temptations were 
          the first Motown recording act to win a Grammy Award - for "Cloud Nine" in 1969 - and in 2014 received 
          the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Six of the Temptations (Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, Ruffin, 
          Otis Williams and Paul Williams) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Three classic 
          Temptations songs, "My Girl", "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)", and "Papa Was a Rollin' 
          Stone", are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. The 
          Temptations were ranked at number 68 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of all 
          time. They were the first Motown artist to get a Grammy Award and to get a Lifetime Achievement Award 
          (which they gained in 2014).</h5>

        <h5>In 2023, the Temptations were ranked as the #1 artist on the Top 100 Greatest R&B/Hip-Hop Artists Of All Time according to Billboard magazine.</h5>
        <h5>As of 2024, the Temptations continue to perform with founder Otis Williams in the lineup (Williams owns the rights to the Temptations name).</h5>

    <h1>ORIGINS</h1>

    <h5>Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams began singing together in 
        church as children and formed a doo-wop quartet in 1955.
        They later moved to Detroit and changed their name to "The Primes" under Milton Jenkins. The Primes became known for 
        their meticulous performances and later created a sister group, 
        "The Primettes", later known as "The Supremes". Kendricks was 
        seen as a "matinee idol" in the Detroit area, while Williams was 
        well-received for his baritone vocals.</h5>

        <h5>In 1958, Otis Williams moved to Detroit from Texas and became the leader 
        of a vocal group called "Otis Williams and the Siberians". The 
        group recorded a song, "Pecos Kid", and later changed its name 
        to "The El Domingoes". The group changed its name to "The 
        Distants" after signing with Johnnie Mae Matthews' Northern 
        Records.</h5>
      
        <h5>The Distants recorded two singles, "Come On" (1959) and 
            "Alright" (1960), with Albert "Mooch" Harrell replacing Pee-Wee 
              Crawford. "Come On" became a local hit, and the Warwick 
              Records label picked the record up for national distribution. 
              Following the release of "Alright", Matthews appointed Williams 
              as the group leader, and the group's name was changed to "Otis 
              Williams & The Distants".</h5>
      
          <h5>Both the Primes and Distants were influenced by other vocal 
              groups, including The Miracles, Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon & The 
              Teenagers, The Drifters, and The Isley Brothers. However, The 
              Distants never saw much record sales and "Alright" was not as 
              successful. After receiving an offer to sign with Motown 
              Records, the remaining members lost use of "The Distants"

              name. Richard Street later formed another Distants group 
              who recorded for the Thelma label in the early 1960s.</h5>

    <h1>EARLY YEARS</h1>

    <h5>The Primes, a rival group of the Distants, disbanded in 1960 after Kell Osborne moved to California. Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams returned to Alabama, and Kendricks offered a lead singer place in his new group, the Temptations, with Paul Williams. The group auditioned for Motown in March 1961 and was signed to Motown imprint Miracle. However, before signing, the group discovered another group using the name Elgins. "The Temptations" became the group's new moniker. The "Elgins" name re-surfaced at Motown in 1965, when Gordy renamed a quartet called the Downbeats as the Elgins.</h5>

    <h5>The Temptations released their first two singles, <i>"Oh Mother of Mine"</i> and <i>"Check Yourself"</i>,   with Paul Williams on lead, on Miracle before Gordy closed the label and reassigned the band to Gordy Records. Eddie Kendricks sang lead on the Temptations' first charted single, <i>"(You're My) Dream Come True"</i>, which peaked at number 22 on the R&B chart in 1962. The group issued eight recordings between 1961 and 1963 without much success. Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks split the leads, with Al Bryant, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin occasionally singing lead. The group almost had their name changed to the Pirates, but both the label and the group decided against it.</h5>
      
    <h5>In 1963, the Temptations began working with Smokey Robinson as producer and writer, with the first work being the Paul Williams-led <i>"I Want a Love I Can See"</i>. Al Bryant became restless and uncooperative due to the group's lack of success. David Ruffin aspired to join the group, impressing them with his vocal talent and dancing skills. Bryant was fired from the group after a heated altercation onstage. David Ruffin was brought in as his replacement in January 1964 following his performance with them in 1963, even though his brother Jimmy had also been considered for the slot earlier. Bryant continued performing in other local groups and died at 36 in Flagler County, Florida, of liver cirrhosis on October 26, 1975.</h5>
