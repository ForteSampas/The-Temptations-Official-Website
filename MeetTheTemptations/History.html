    <p>Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with fewer or more members), the group 
        formed in 1960 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Detroit</b></i></a> under the name <i><b>"The Elgins"</b></i>. The founding members came from two rival Detroit

    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <h1>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
    <h1>ORIGINS</h1>
    <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/Young Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams 2.jpg" alt="Young Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams 2" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
    </a>
    <p>Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams began singing together in 
        church as children in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama"><i><b>Birmingham, Alabama</b></i></a>.
        By their teenage years, they formed a doo-wop quartet in 1955 with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kell_Osborne"><i><b>Kell Osborne</b></i></a> and Wiley Waller, naming themselves the Cavaliers.
        They later moved to Detroit and changed their name to "The Primes" under Milton Jenkins. The Primes became known for 
        their meticulous performances and later created a sister group, 
        "The Primettes", later known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>"The Supremes"</b></i></a>. Kendricks was 
        seen as a "matinee idol" in the Detroit area, while Williams was 
        well-received for his baritone vocals.</p>
        <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/Young Otis Williams.jpg" alt="Young Otis Williams" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
        <p>In 1958, Otis Williams moved to Detroit from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texarkana,_Texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Texas</b></i></a> and became the leader 
        of a vocal group called "Otis Williams and the Siberians", by 1958.
        The group included Elbridge "Al" Bryant, James "Pee-Wee" Crawford, Vernard Plain and Arthur Walton. 
        The group recorded a song, "Pecos Kid" for a label run by radio deejay Senator Bristol Bryant. Shortly after its release, the group changed its name to The El Domingoes.
        Subsequently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Montgomery</b></i></a> native Melvin Franklin replaced Arthur Walton as bass vocalist and Detroit-born Richard Street (claimed by Melvin Franklin to be his cousin) replaced Vernard Plain as lead singer. Signing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Mae_Matthews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Johnnie Mae Matthews</b></i></a>' Northern Records, the group had their name changed again to the Distants.</p>
      
        <p>The Distants recorded two singles, "Come On" (1959) and 
            "Alright" (1960), with Albert "Mooch" Harrell replacing Pee-Wee 
              Crawford. "Come On" became a local hit, and the Warwick 
              Records label picked the record up for national distribution. 
              Following the release of "Alright", Matthews appointed Williams 
              as the group leader, and the group's name was changed to "Otis 
              Williams & The Distants".</p>
      
          <p>Both the Primes and Distants were influenced by other vocal 
              groups, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miracles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>The Miracles</b></i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cadillacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>The Cadillacs</b></i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Teenagers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers</b></i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>The Drifters</b></i></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isley_Brothers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>The Isley Brothers</b></i></a>. However, The 
              Distants never saw much record sales and "Alright" was not as 
              successful. After receiving an offer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_Gordy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Berry Gordy</b></i></a> to sign with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Motown Records</b></i></a>, the remaining members lost use of "The Distants"
              name. Richard Street later formed another Distants group 
              who recorded for the Thelma label in the early 1960s.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>EARLY YEARS</h1>
    <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations' Early 1960's Original Lineup.jpg" alt="The Temptations' Early 1960's Original Lineup" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
    </a>
    <p>The Primes, a rival group of the Distants, disbanded in 1960 after Kell Osborne moved to California. Eddie Kendricks and 
      Paul Williams returned to Alabama, and Kendricks offered a lead singer place in his new group, the Temptations, with Paul 
      Williams. The group auditioned for Motown in March 1961 and was signed to Motown imprint Miracle. However, before signing, 
      the group discovered another group using the name Elgins. "The Temptations" became the group's new moniker. The "Elgins" 
      name re-surfaced at Motown in 1965, when Gordy renamed a quartet called the Downbeats as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elgins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>"The Elgins"</b></i></a>.</p>

    <p>The Temptations released their first two singles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Mother_of_Mine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>"Oh Mother of Mine"</b></i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Yourself" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>"Check Yourself"</b></i></a>, with Paul 
      Williams on lead, on Miracle before Gordy closed the label and reassigned the band to Gordy Records. Eddie Kendricks sang 
      lead on the Temptations' first charted single, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(You%27re_My)_Dream_Come_True" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>"(You're My) Dream Come True"</b></i></a>, which peaked at number 22 on the R&B 
      chart in 1962. Later that year, the Temptations began touring as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motortown_Revue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Motortown Revue</b></i></a>. The group issued eight recordings between 1961 and 1963 without much success. Paul Williams and Eddie 
      Kendricks split the leads, with Al Bryant, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin occasionally singing lead. The group almost 
      had their name changed to the Pirates, but both the label and the group decided against it.</p>
    <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations feat. Smokey Robinson.jpg" alt="The Temptations feat. Smokey Robinson" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px"> 
    <p>In 1963, the Temptations began working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Robinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Smokey Robinson</b></i></a> as producer and writer, with the first work being the Paul 
        Williams-led <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_a_Love_I_Can_See" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>"I Want a Love I Can See"  </b></i></a>. Al Bryant became restless and uncooperative due to the group's lack of 
        success.  After a second altercation onstage at a Christmas performance, following an incident where he struck Paul with a beer bottle during a heated quarrel at an earlier gig in the middle of the year, Bryant was summarily fired from the group.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ruffin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>David Ruffin</b></i></a> aspired to join the group, impressing them with his vocal talent and dancing skills and he was brought in as Bryant's replacement in January 1964, 
        following his performance with them in 1963, even though his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Ruffin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Jimmy Ruffin</b></i></a> had also been considered for the slot earlier. 
        Bryant continued performing in other local groups and died at 36 years old in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagler_County,_Florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>Flagler County, Florida</b></i></a>, 
        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><b>liver cirrhosis</b></i></a> on October 26, 1975.</p>

    <p><a href="file:///C:/Users/aquel/.vscode/HTML/TheTemptationsOfficialWebsite2/MeetTheTemptations/Richard%20Street.html"><i><b>Richard Street</b></i></a> later formed another Distants group who recorded for the Thelma label in the early 1960s.</p>
    <br>
    <h1><i>"CLASSIC FIVE"</i> ERA</h1>
    <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations 25.jpg" alt="The Temptations 25" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
    </a>
    <p><i>"The Temptations"</i>, then consisted of Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams, Eddie Kendricks, and David 
        Ruffin. The success that followed the group resulted in what would, in later years, be frequently referred to as the 
       <i>"Classic Five"</i> lineup. In January 1964, Smokey Robinson co-wrote and produced Eddie Kendricks led-"The Way You Do 
        The Things You Do", with <i>"Miracles"</i> bandmate Bobby Rogers. That song became the group's first Top 20 hit that April. 
        The group's first album, <i>"Meet the Temptations"</i>, was released in early 1964.</p>

    <p>In 1964, the group recorded two singles with Eddie Kendricks on lead, but producer Smokey Robinson saw potential in the 
       <i>"mellow yet gruff"</i> voice of David Ruffin. While traveling as part of <i>"Motown's Motortown Revue"</i> later that 
       year, Robinson and fellow <i>"Miracles"</i> member Ronnie White wrote <i>"My Girl"</i>, which The Temptations recorded in 
       the fall of 1964 with Ruffin singing his first lead vocal for the group. Released as a single on December 21, 1964, 
       the song became The Temptations' first number-one pop hit in March 1965.</p>
    <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations 17.jpg" alt="The Temptations 17" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
    <p>60 years and multiple chart topping songs later, it is still their signature song to this day. Following the comercial 
        success of <i>"My Girl"</i>, Ruffin also sang lead on three singles, including <i>"It's Growing"</i>, 
        <i>"Since I Lost My Baby"</i>, and <i>"My Baby"</i>, all making it to the Top 20 in 1965. 
      The B-side to <i>"My Baby"</i>, <i>"Don't Look Back"</i>, featured a stirring lead from Paul Williams, and was a sleeper hit 
      on the R&B charts and a standard for vocal group playlists.</p>
      <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations 7 Colorized.jpg" alt="The Temptations 7 Colorized" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
      <p>Norman Whitfield requested the opportunity to write for the group, and in 1966, Berry Gordy promised him that if Smokey 
        Robinson's <i>"Get Ready"</i> failed to chart in the Top 20, Whitfield would be allowed to produce the next song.
        <i>"Get Ready"</i> subsequently missed its mark, and Gordy issued the Whitfield-produced <i>"Ain't Too Proud to Beg"</i>, 
        with David Ruffin on lead, as the next single. <i>"Ain't Too Proud to Beg"</i>, outperformed <i>"Get Ready"</i> on the 
        Billboard charts, and Whitfield became The Temptations' new main producer.</p>
        <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/Norman-Whitfield.jpg" alt="Norman Whitfield" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
        <p>He began pulling the group away from the ballad-based productions espoused by Smokey Robinson, toward a harder-edged 
            and brass-heavy soul sound reminiscent of <i>James Brown</i>.</p>
        <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations 10 Colorized.jpg" alt="The Temptations 10 Colorized" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
        <p>Prior to 1968, nearly all singles produced by Norman Whitfield featured David Ruffin on lead, including the R&B 
          number-one/pop Top 10 hits <i>"Beauty Is Only Skin Deep"</i>, <i>"(I Know) I'm Losing You"</i>, and 
          <i>"(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need"</i>.</p>

        <p>Other notable singles from this period include <i>"All I Need"</i>, produced by Frank Wilson, and 
          <i>"You're My Everything"</i>, with Kendricks and Ruffin sharing lead.</p>
        <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations 15 Colorized.jpg" alt="The Temptations 15 Colorized" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
        <p>Studio albums during the <i>"Classic Five"</i> period include <i>"The Temptations Sing Smokey"</i>, 
          <i>"The Temptin' Temptations"</i>, <i>"Gettin' Ready"</i>, <i>"The Temptations with a Lot o' Soul"</i>, 
          and <i>"The Temptations Wish It Would Rain".</i></p>
        <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/Barrett Strong.jpg" alt="Barrett Strong" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
        <p>During this period, the various songwriting partners of Norman Whitfield included Roger Penzabene, Edward Holland, Jr., 
          and Temptations road show manager and guitarist Cornelius Grant.</p>

        <p>Subsequently, Barrett Strong, who sang the first hit at Motown in 1959, named "Money (That's What I Want)", 
            began working with Whitfield and Penzabene on Temptations material after Eddie Holland left Motown with the rest of 
            the Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting/production team in 1967.</p>
        <img src="../TheTemptationsGallery/The Temptations 27.jpg" alt="The Temptations 27" class="center" height="1000px" width="1400px">
        <p>Two of the Whitfield-Strong-Penzabene collaborations, "I Wish It Would Rain" and 
            "I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)", became hits in early 1968 following the suicide of Roger Penzabene 
             in December 1967. Subsequently, Barrett Strong became the sole collaborator of Norman Whitfield.</p>

        <p>From early 1964 to mid 1968, the Temptations went from unknown hopefuls to international stars and as a result, 
            appeared frequently on television shows such as American Bandstand, The Ed Sullivan Show, and The Hollywood Palace. 
            At the same time, the group began to achieve a crossover success, catering to middle America with a pop standards 
            album (The Temptations in a Mellow Mood, 1967), the success of which resulted in performances at the famous 
            Copacabana in New York City in 1968 along with dates at other similar supper clubs. Outside of music, 
            The Temptations were made honorary members of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.</p>

       singer, riding to and from gigs in a private mink-lined limousine with his 
       then-girlfriend, Motown singer Tammi Terrell, instead of the group
       limousine used by the other four Temptations.</p>
